# Predict-the-Severity-of-an-Accident

# 1. Introduction

Traffic accidents are a significant source of deaths, injuries, property damage, and a major concern for public health and traffic safety. Accidents are also a major cause of 
traffic congestion and delay. Effective management of accident is crucial to mitigating accident impacts and improving traffic safety and transportation system efficiency. 
Accurate predictions of severity can provide crucial information for emergency responders to evaluate the severity level of accidents, estimate the potential impacts, and implement efficient accident management procedures. By recognizing the key factors that influence accident severity, the solution may be of great utility to various Government Departments/Authorities like DOT and Police. The results of analysis and modeling can be used by these Departments to take appropriate measures; such as early warning system to drivers; to reduce accident impact and thereby improve traffic safety. It is also useful to the Insurers in terms of reduced claims and better underwriting as well as rate making.

# 2. Data Understanding
The dataset come from City of Seattle Open Data Portal that contains all types of collisions from 2004 to Present. This raw dataset consists of 221,266 cases and 40 attributes. The description of each columns can be found in this link

SEVERITYCODE feature is the target variable to predict the severity of car accidents. It is a categorical feature that is defined as 1, 2 to indicate the accident was of 
Prop Damage only, Injury.

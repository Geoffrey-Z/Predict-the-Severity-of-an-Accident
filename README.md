# Predict-the-Severity-of-an-Accident

# 1. Introduction

In this project, we will be working on a case study which is to predict the severity of an accident. Say you are driving to another city for work or to visit some friends. It is rainy and windy, and on the way, you come across a terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. As you keep driving, police cars start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. Oh, it is an accident and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the nearest hospital. They must be in critical condition for all of this to be happening. Now, wouldn't it be great if there is something in place that could warn you, given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that you would drive more carefully or even change your travel if you are able to.

Traffic accidents are a significant source of deaths, injuries, property damage, and a major concern for public health and traffic safety. Accidents are also a major cause of 
traffic congestion and delay. Effective management of accident is crucial to mitigating accident impacts and improving traffic safety and transportation system efficiency. 
Accurate predictions of severity can provide crucial information for emergency responders to evaluate the severity level of accidents, estimate the potential impacts, and implement efficient accident management procedures. By recognizing the key factors that influence accident severity, the solution may be of great utility to various Government Departments/Authorities like DOT and Police. The results of analysis and modeling can be used by these Departments to take appropriate measures; such as early warning system to drivers; to reduce accident impact and thereby improve traffic safety. It is also useful to the Insurers in terms of reduced claims and better underwriting as well as rate making.

# 2. Data Understanding
The dataset come from City of Seattle Open Data Portal that contains all types of collisions from 2004 to Present. This raw dataset consists of 221,266 cases and 40 attributes. The description of each columns can be found in this link 

https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf

SEVERITYCODE feature is the target variable to predict the severity of car accidents. It is a categorical feature that is defined as 1, 2 to indicate the accident was of 
Prop Damage only, Injury.

The plot above tells us that there is a extreme imbalance for the target variable.

I remove features in dataset that may:
- have high percentage of missing data over 85%.
- irrelevant to accident severity such as ReportNo, Status.
- be derived from others features such as SEVERITYDESC, SEGLANEKEY. These derived features donâ€™t add value to dataset. It also create unnecessary correlation between features.
- be provided after the accidents has been reported and processed such as count of Fatality victims based on its severity. Post accidents features create strong bias into our model.

Each features are examined thoroughly for its consistency for every classes. Some features clearly stand out as a differentiator for a class but indistinguishable on other classes.

# 3.2 Feature Engineering
The time and date of when the accident happens maybe contain some information. For example, Friday evening road traffic gets heavier increasing the probability of road accident. I extract MONTH, DAY, HOUR features from accident date and time. We can see that these three new features somewhat related to accident severity. For example, be in a traffic in Friday night December increases the chance of fatality accident.

Latitude and longitude feature are converted to Cartesian coordinate assuming the earth is sphere. From the scatter plot below we can see property damages accident is everywhere but fatality accidents are at certain location.

After data clean up, feature engineering and hot encode categorical data, the clean dataset has 75 predictors with 184,146 samples.

# 4. Methodology

Logistic Regression and Random Forest models are used to solve the problem which is to predict the accident severity. I use the following techniques to handle the imbalance in the dataset:

- Feed the models with resampled train data after train_test_split process. I use SMOTE algorithm from imblearn-learn package for oversampling.

![image](https://github.com/Geoffrey-Z/Predict-the-Severity-of-an-Accident/blob/master/IMG/download%20(25).png)

- The weighting can penalize the model less for errors made on examples from the majority class and penalize the model more for errors made on examples from the minority class.

# 5. Evaluation

I use F1 score as the main metric to evaluate the performance of the different trained models. Accuracy is not best metric of choice when evaluating imbalanced datasets as it would bias toward majority class.

- Precision: the number of true positives divided by all positive predictions. Precision is also called Positive Predictive Value. It is a measure of a classifier's exactness. Low precision indicates a high number of false positives.

- Recall: the number of true positives divided by the number of positive values in the test data. Recall is also called Sensitivity or the True Positive Rate. It is a measure of a classifier's completeness. Low recall indicates a high number of false negatives.

- F1 Score: the weighted average of precision and recall.

Each model is evaluated to predict classes from test data that has 46,037 samples.

## Models Metrics Summary
![image](https://github.com/Geoffrey-Z/Predict-the-Severity-of-an-Accident/blob/master/IMG/download%20(27).png)

Looking at the table above, it seems like Logistic Regression - oversample model is the best with f1 score 0.71. RandomForest - Oversample that has f1 score 0.67. However, RandomForest hasn't tuned hyperparameter yet. After tuning hyperparameters, the score maybe be better.

## 5.1 Cross Validation

On the winner model, oversampling was done only one time over minority classes. We need to do cross validation on our model to verify its consistency. First we split the dataset into training and validation folds, oversampling, train classifier on training folds and then finally validate the classifier on remaining fold.

## 5.2 RandomizedSearchCV - Hyperparameter Tuning Winner Model
The winner model is further investigated to see if its performance can be increased by tuning some hyperparameter in the model. The process is almost the same with cross validation mentioned previously. The difference is combination of parameters on each train fold are tested to find the best f1 score. This whole process took 448.7 minutes in a single quad core machine.

With tuned parameters, the model overall score were improved, specifically F1 score increased from 0.67 to 0.82.

6. Discussion
The clean dataset has 75 features that mostly categorical. Majority of the features are somewhat interrelated to each other. That said, no features left behind...A tuned parameter RandomForest fed with oversampled data can predict 74% true positive on 74 samples out of 47,359 samples in class F, a 0.15% of test set population. It's quite impressive.

7. Conclusion
Car collisions severity prediction is a classic problem. Many academic papers have been published on this matter with different approaches statistical, machine learning, and deep learning. In this study, I use machine learning approach to analyze the relationship between accident severity with given set of features. The challenge is real life data always imbalance. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to solve imbalance data and followed by tuned RandomForest algorithm performs well.
